I am a postdoctoral researcher at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center, working primarily with [Prof. Kushal K. Dey](https://www.mskcc.org/research/ski/labs/kushal-dey) and secondarily with [Prof. Rahul Mazumder](https://www.mit.edu/~rahulmaz/). 
My research focuses on developing statistical methods to analyze spatial transcriptomics and identify disease-informative gene programs. 
I obtained my PhD in Statistics from Purdue University under the joint supervision of [Prof. Jean Honorio](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/jhonorio/) and [Prof. Qifan Song](https://www.stat.purdue.edu/~qfsong/). 
Before that, I earned an MS in Statistics at Seoul National University, supervised by [Prof. Joong-Ho Won](https://won-j.github.io/). 

My first name is pronounced as /h…ënbil/. :) It means big star in Korean.

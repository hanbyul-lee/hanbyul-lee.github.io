I'm a PhD student in the Department of Statistics at Purdue Univerisity. 
I have broad interests in the statistical foundation of machine learning, and my current research involves incomplete data analysis, dimension reduction and variable selection. 
I have particularly focused on the analysis of structurally missing data based on graph theory, which is motivated by the fact that data missing pattern is usually unknown and not at random in real world applications.
I am interested in the problems of differential privacy and federated learning as well.

I'm supervised by [Prof. Jean Honorio](https://www.cs.purdue.edu/homes/jhonorio/) and [Prof. Qifan Song](https://www.stat.purdue.edu/~qfsong/).
Before joining Purdue, I obtained MS in Statistics at Seoul National University, supervised by [Prof. Joong-Ho Won](https://won-j.github.io/).

My first name is pronounced as /h…ënbil/. :)
